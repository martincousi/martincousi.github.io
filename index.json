Specifically, we assume that the selection of bus stops for each request, along with the bus routes, is determined by the booking system using an optimization algorithm. We focus on service quality by lexicographically minimizing passenger travel time (including both walking time and time spent on the bus) and the total route length. We introduce a new matheuristic algorithm based on small and large neighborhood search, incorporating state-of-the-art operators and a set covering component. This algorithm outperforms previous approaches by over 24\\% and shows good performance on related problems benchmarks. The algorithm is tested on a new set of instances, based on real data from New York City, which we propose as a future benchmark.

This study highlights the importance of state relations in global supply chain reconfiguration. Political divergence between governments provides a dual-view of political risk (i.e. buyer–supplier countries), which can help firms anticipate geopolitical disruptions. While reducing supply bases in foreign countries facing heightened geopolitical tensions is intended to mitigate disruptions, these supply base adjustments are linked to increased supply base complexity and sub-tier supplier sharing, thereby exposing firms to other types of supply disruptions.

This study evaluates the potential role of decreased data visibility on these shortages, analysing different forecasting methods integrated with a periodic review inventory system (i.e. a base stock policy) on semi-simulated data encompassing several visibility issues. The forecasting methods chosen pertain to different data types: Holt and naïve methods are used as demand-based predictors, while a modified epidemiological model utilises pandemic data for demand forecasting. We scrutinise three prevalent data visibility issues through specifically crafted scenarios examining the effects of delayed, temporally aggregated, and erroneous data on system performance. Generally, our research illustrates that data visibility issues have a detrimental impact on the healthcare supply chain's efficacy. Interestingly, the system performance sees an uptick when these issues spur significantly oversized over-forecasts, e.g. when employing an epidemiological compartmental model for predictions.","tags":["inventory management","COVID-19","forecasting","digitalization","healthcare"],"title":"The effect of visibility on forecast and inventory management performance during the COVID-19 pandemic","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R Charpin","M Cousineau"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1723186800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1723186800,"objectID":"5eda27868279ca87798eca5b13d56935","permalink":"https://martincousi.github.io/talk/friendshoring-how-geopolitical-tensions-affect-foreign-supply-bases-and-supply-network-structures-aom/","publishdate":"2024-08-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/friendshoring-how-geopolitical-tensions-affect-foreign-supply-bases-and-supply-network-structures-aom/","section":"event","summary":"Geopolitical tensions can lead to supply disruptions for firms with foreign supply bases. At the origin of these tensions lies disagreement in global affairs between nations that can lead to national animosity and the implementation of discriminatory practices toward foreign firms. In this study, we examine the influence of geopolitical tensions—operationalized as political divergence between governments—on global supply chain reconfiguration. Over the period 2003-2019, we investigate if political divergence affects foreign supply bases for 3,201 US firms sourcing from 108 countries, and how political divergence exposure impacts the supply network structure of 934 US firms. We find that while political divergence leads firms to reduce their supply base in hostile countries, it increases supply base complexity and sub-tier supplier sharing. Our study makes important theoretical and practical contributions to global sourcing and supply chain risk management. First, we highlight that geopolitical risk in global supply chains can originate from political divergence, which recognizes potential interventions from the governments of both the buyer and the supplier. It also captures the uncertainty associated with geopolitical disruptions before their occurrence. Second, we show that while using multi-sourcing as a buffering strategy can mitigate geopolitical disruptions, it also increases supply base complexity and thus expose the firm to other types of disruptions. Last, we uncover an unintended consequence of friendshoring. As firms reduce their supply base in hostile countries, their tier-1 suppliers end up sharing more tier-2 suppliers, amplifying the propagation risk in the focal firm’s supply network.","tags":["political risk","supply chain"],"title":"Friendshoring: How geopolitical tensions affect foreign supply bases and supply network structures (AOM)","type":"event"},{"authors":["ND Kullman","N Dudorov","M Cousineau","JE Mendoza","JC Goodson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1720051200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1720051200,"objectID":"a82c42ea6d5ad85a702087d83da137c3","permalink":"https://martincousi.github.io/publication/gamifying-vrpsr/","publishdate":"2024-07-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gamifying-vrpsr/","section":"publication","summary":"Do you remember your first video game console?

However, recent studies have highlighted the gap between the routes offered by classical optimization algorithms and the routes followed by experienced drivers. As a result, researchers have turned their attention towards the acquisition and inclusion of drivers’ knowledge to learn the order in which each customer is going to be served by the driver. In this study, we describe and solve a new problem called the multiple time window learning problem. In contrast to other VRP variants, the goal is to learn the time windows associated with each customer. Our approaches are based on the observation and exploitation of historical data with a new algorithm called the recall heuristic, and the exploration of new information based on the multi-armed bandit problem. Computational results based on real data extracted from a traffic sign dataset from the city of Montreal showed that our approaches can learn time windows and, as a result, propose routes similar to those created by experienced drivers, while still minimizing the routing costs.","tags":["multi-armed bandit","machine learning","transportation"],"title":"Learning implicit multiple time windows in the traveling salesman problem","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M Cousineau","V Verter","SA Murphy","J Pineau"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1673827200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1673827200,"objectID":"6a08f7cc1f20dd3aa67e5de12bddc93f","permalink":"https://martincousi.github.io/publication/causal-effects-optimization/","publishdate":"2022-02-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/causal-effects-optimization/","section":"publication","summary":"In the absence of randomized controlled and natural experiments, it is necessary to balance the distributions of (observable) covariates of the treated and control groups in order to obtain an unbiased estimate of a causal effect of interest; otherwise, a different effect size may be estimated, and incorrect recommendations may be given. To achieve this balance, there exist a wide variety of methods. In particular, several methods based on optimization models have been recently proposed in the causal inference literature. While these optimization-based methods empirically showed an improvement over a limited number of other causal inference methods in their relative ability to balance the distributions of covariates and to estimate causal effects, they have not been thoroughly compared to each other and to other noteworthy causal inference methods. In addition, we believe that there exist several unaddressed opportunities that operational researchers could contribute with their advanced knowledge of optimization, for the benefits of the applied researchers that use causal inference tools.

The operator, seeking to maximize profit, must assign vehicles to requests as they arise as well as recharge and reposition vehicles in anticipation of future requests. To solve this problem, we employ deep reinforcement learning, developing policies whose decision making uses Q-value approximations learned by deep neural networks. We compare these policies against a reoptimization-based policy and against dual bounds on the value of an optimal policy, including the value of an optimal policy with perfect information, which we establish using a Benders-based decomposition. We assess performance on instances derived from real data for the island of Manhattan in New York City. We find that, across instances of varying size, our best policy trained with deep reinforcement learning outperforms the reoptimization approach.

It obviously applies to the field of supply chain management, where information flow management plays a major role. In Quebec (Canada), the digitalization of the supply chain of healthcare institutions seems to have historical shortcomings: the presence of large inventories in the various links of the supply chain combined with shortages or stock-outs. However, digitalization can be a promising avenue to improve the performance of healthcare institutions. Considering the investments required to make such a shift, supply chain digitalization must be carried out strategically in order to maximize the benefits. It is therefore important to diagnose the state of practices in healthcare institutions in order to guide decision-makers' choices. The purpose of this article is to answer the following research question: What is the level of digital maturity of the internal supply chain in healthcare institutions in the province of Quebec? In order to collect the data necessary to answer the research question, a questionnaire was administered to measure the digital maturity of the internal supply chain of healthcare institutions on four dimensions: automation, predictive data analytics, clinical integration, and governance and leadership. The analyses conducted show that the level of digital maturity of healthcare institutions is generally low. Consequently, significant efforts are required to reach a higher level of maturity. In particular, governance and leadership seem to play an important role. Therefore, decision-makers must take the time to assess the presence of leadership before initiating more elaborate digitalization projects.","tags":["digitalization","supply chain","healthcare"],"title":"Le niveau de maturité digitale de la chaîne logistique interne des établissements de santé de la province de Québec: une étude exploratoire","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M Cousineau","J-N Nikiema","JT Martineau","C Régis"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1655208000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655208000,"objectID":"08a7dac011e6cb91617ee36f8353418e","permalink":"https://martincousi.github.io/talk/quest-ce-que-lia-en-sante-obvia/","publishdate":"2022-06-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/quest-ce-que-lia-en-sante-obvia/","section":"event","summary":"Une vulgarisation de l'IA en santé.","tags":["artificial intelligence","machine learning","operations research","health"],"title":"Qu'est-ce que l'IA en santé?

In a practical inventory system when backlog costs can be incurred in multiple stages, this problem cannot be solved analytically and it is intractable to solve by traditional optimization methods. To alleviate the curse of dimensionality in this problem, we apply and compare three efficient deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms namely Deep Q-network, Advantage Actor-Critic and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, to efficiently determine the inventory policy. We consider a serial supply chain as in the beer game, a classic multi-echelon inventory problem, and extend the application of DRL to the centralized decision-making setting which is more complex due to significantly larger state and action space. We also propose a heuristic-guided exploration mechanism to improve the training efficiency by incorporating known heuristics into the exploration process of the DRL algorithms. The experiments show that in both decentralized and centralized settings, the DRL agents learned policies with significant cost savings compared to benchmark heuristics.","tags":["inventory management","reinforcement learning","machine learning"],"title":"Solving multi-echelon inventory problems with heuristic-guided deep reinforcement learning and centralized control","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Q Zhong","Y Adulyasak","M Cousineau","R Jans"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1630396800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630396800,"objectID":"a3c3ad5c7d4583a68f37b5c4a9b71bca","permalink":"https://martincousi.github.io/talk/solving-multi-echelon-inventory-management-problems-with-deep-reinforcement-learning-iwls/","publishdate":"2021-08-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/solving-multi-echelon-inventory-management-problems-with-deep-reinforcement-learning-iwls/","section":"event","summary":"A technical talk on reinforcement learning for inventory control.","tags":["inventory management","reinforcement learning","machine learning"],"title":"Solving multi-echelon inventory management problems with deep reinforcement learning (IWLS)","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" This post represents my own views. Other supervisors may have different opinions.   There exist several types of supervised projects. In this post, I will focus on writing a report for a supervised project within an organization. Some of my comments may also apply to other types of supervised project.\nSome relevant official references from HEC Montréal are:\n MSc supervised projects \u0026ndash; guidelines and requirements (english / français); Guidelines for writing an academic work at a graduate level (english / français); Citing your sources (english / français).  You should look at these previous references since they complement this post. It is your responsibility to submit a report that is concise, polished and well structured.\nStructure Main sections A supervised project report is typically around 50 to 60 pages long (excluding the appendices) and generally includes the following sections:\n Introduction (explanation of the context and description of your mandate); Literature review (highlight of some relevant literature, approximately 10 to 30 scientific articles or textbooks); Methods (explanation of the steps you took to accomplish your mandate, e.g., interviews, models, code); Results (discussion of the results you have obtained and proposition of some recommandations (if applicable)); Conclusions (summarisation of your project, and discussion of the limitations and future possible improvements).  Note that it is also important to highlight some links between your project and your learnings in the specialization. This can be highlighted in a paragraph of the Conclusions section, for example.\nOther components In addition to these previous sections, your report should also contain the following front matter (prior to the Introduction):\n Title page (not listed in Table of contents); Table of contents; List of tables (listed in Table of contents); List of figures (listed in Table of contents).  The Title page should be counted but not numbered. The other components should be numbered in lower Roman numerals, starting at ii. Then, the main sections will be numbered with Arabic numerals starting at 1. In order to simplify the creation of your Table of contents, and List of tables and List of figures, you can respectively use the \u0026ldquo;Styles\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Insert Caption\u0026rdquo; options of Microsoft Word; this will ensure that these components are up to date.\nThe back matter (listed in Table of contents) is numbered with Arabic numerals (continuing the numbering from the main sections) and contains the following sections:\n Appendices (documentation of your additional tables and figures, and code (if applicable)); List of references (documentation of the references cited in the report).  The Appendices should contain the tables, figures and other elements that are not essential to the understanding of the main text. The essential tables and figures should be in your main text.\nLanguage It is important that you adopt a professional writing style in your report and don\u0026rsquo;t use casual sentences. You can refer to the above \u0026ldquo;Guidelines for writing an academic work at a graduate level\u0026rdquo; document or to any scientific articles for examples of such sentences. You can also ask someone else to read your report (if not forbidden by a non-disclosure agreement).\nIn addition, make sure that there are transitions between the different sections of your report and that the story flows naturally. You want the reader to be able to read your report without having to go back and forth.\nFurthermore, on the first use of an acronym, you need to spell out the words first followed by the acronym in parentheses, e.g., operations management (OM), supply chains (SCs).\nFinally, support and courses are also offered by the Business Language Training Centre (CLFA). In particular, you can register for free to four one-on-one tutoring sessions over four weeks to revise your supervised project report (english / français).\nTables and figures Tables and figures are an essential part of your report in order to convey results, among others. These, however, need to be presented in a professional manner in order for the reader to appreciate them. First, your tables and figures should have a caption that explains their content and other characteristics (if applicable). Note that a caption generally goes above a table and below a figure.\nSecond, your tables and figures should come after they are introduced in the text, e.g., \u0026ldquo;As shown in Table 2, the \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip; results (see Figure 1)\u0026rdquo;. Note that all tables and figures should be introduced in the text (including the ones in the appendices).\nThird, your tables should have a table header (i.e., a row at the top of the table used to label each column). These labels (generally in bold font) as well as each entry in the table should be concise and easy to read. These tables should be designed directly in Microsoft Word and not a screenshot from another software.\nFinally, your figures should have a high-resolution so that they are easy to read. Ideally, you should reproduce these figures in PowerPoint, for example, instead of doing a screenshot if they are simple. If you use a figure (or table) from another source, it is important to acknowledge this source (in the caption) and make sure that you have the right to use it.\nReferences Your Literature review section, in particular, as well as other sections should contain several citations. It is important to adopt a consistent format for these citations throughout your report. Most report are typically generated using the author-year format (e.g., format of the American Psychological Association (APA)). This format will also dictate how your references are written in your List of references. You can refer to the above \u0026ldquo;Citing your sources\u0026rdquo; reference for more information regarding this topic. For information regarding the prefered format at HEC Montréal, you can refer to this guide (in french only); this format is similar to the APA 6th edition format.\nNote I highly recommend you to use a reference management software to manage these citations. This software will also automatically generate your list of references according to the format you want. Some popular reference management software are:\n EndNote (free through HEC Montréal, see this link for more info); Mendeley (free, the software I am using); Zotero (free basic version).  If you don\u0026rsquo;t know where to start with your literature review, you can refer to this pedagogical note (english / français). It may, however, be a bit too advanced depending on the type of your project.\nYou can also contact the librarian for the Logistics and Operations Management department. This person is highly qualified to help you with your literature review, and can help you determine the appropriate databases to search, the relevant keywords, etc.\nEvaluation Note that your report will be evaluated by your supervisor (or co-supervisors) as well as one examiner. To do so, the evaluation grid at the end of the above \u0026ldquo;MSc supervised projects \u0026ndash; guidelines and requirements\u0026rdquo; document will be used. It is thus important to look at whether and how your report adresses all of these elements.\nAdvancement In conclusion, it is important to keep in touch with your supervisor during your supervised project and writing of the report, to avoid unpleasant surprises. You also need to send the initial draft of your report to your supervisor well before the deadline (e.g., one month before) to allow enough time for modifications. Note that a good practice is to include your name and the date of your draft in the filename to facilitate the follow-up among the different versions.\n","date":1630022400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630022400,"objectID":"0b0cf12637016e047fa61b92ae694c22","permalink":"https://martincousi.github.io/post/writing-supervised-project-report/","publishdate":"2021-08-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/writing-supervised-project-report/","section":"post","summary":"This post represents my own views.

In particular, this work focuses on methods to assist physicians towards achieving remission in patients suffering from treatment-resistant depression, a severe form of the major depressive disorder. Following a literature review of medical decision making methods relevant for treating depression, this thesis proposes medical decision making methods for (1) finding the best initial treatment modification for incoming patients, (2) characterizing the current timing decisions between appointments and (3) recommending potential successful treatments. All of these tasks are addressed using observational longitudinal data from the Depressive and Suicide Disorders Program of the Douglas Mental Health University Institute in Montreal.In particular, the first method focuses on the task of using observational data to determine which of five treatment modification strategies is best at the initial visit. To do so, the proposed method balances the five strategy groups using an improved approach for causal inference. The chapter associated with this method is also used as a tutorial to causal inference for the operations research and management science community.The second method identifies the relevant variables among the patient's, physician's and clinic's characteristics for the timing decisions between appointments. This decision is of importance due to the trade-off between high-frequency appointments that lead to a waste of resources and low-frequency appointments that lead to the degradation of patients. Using imitation learning on data, this method infers these variables and their weights. This knowledge can then be used by the physicians to refine and standardize their practice with respect to this decision.The third method recommends potential successful treatments using similarities between past patients and treatments. This recommender system consists somewhat of an extension of the first method where causal inference is again used. However, the treatment drugs are now considered instead of the five treatment modification strategies. For this method, we assume that the sequence of treatments that have been administered to the patient does not affect the efficacy of the current treatment.","tags":["analytics","healthcare","depression"],"title":"Analytics for medical decision making: Applications to the management of treatment-resistant depression","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M Cousineau","S Perron","G Caporossi","M Paiva","M Segatto"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"298bf6eeba5a19a3d27d3f64e0b99ed4","permalink":"https://martincousi.github.io/publication/rwa-otn/","publishdate":"2021-05-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rwa-otn/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents a decomposition approach for solving a variant of the routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problem, in which all connection requests are covered by geodesics, i.e., shortest paths with respect to the number of hops.

Our decomposition approach is an extension of a recent method proposed in the literature, for the case of shortest paths. We also modify this method by proposing an improved path selection phase. The decomposition approach consists of four phases: (i) shortest paths computation; (ii) lower bound computation; (iii) selection of a shortest path per connection request; (iv) assignment of a wavelength to each connection request. Several methods have been proposed for the different phases but only one per phase has been kept after numerical experiments. This approach as well as a direct approach have been tested on 29 optical transport networks. The decomposition approach was able to solve these instances in less time than the direct approach while finding the optimal solution for 28 of them. For the remaining network, the approach was able to provide a small interval in which the optimal solution value resides. Finally, this approach can be used to accelerate the solution process of the direct approach by providing a good upper bound and a near optimal initial solution.","tags":["constrained optimization","constraint programming","optical transport networks"],"title":"Optimisation du routage et de l'affectation de longueurs d'onde sur un réseau de télécommunication par programmation mathématique","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H Gagnon","M Cousineau","A Adler","AE Hartinger"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1276473600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1276473600,"objectID":"df80252e9744aca3e0a315e38dfad22f","permalink":"https://martincousi.github.io/publication/phantom-eit/","publishdate":"2021-05-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/phantom-eit/","section":"publication","summary":"Assessing the performance of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) systems usually requires a phantom for validation, calibration, or comparison purposes. This paper describes a resistive mesh phantom to assess the performance of EIT systems while taking into account cabling stray effects similar to in vivo conditions. This phantom is built with 340 precision resistors on a printed circuit board representing a 2-D circular homogeneous medium. It also integrates equivalent electrical models of the Ag/AgCl electrode impedances. The parameters of the electrode models were fitted from impedance curves measured with an impedance analyzer. The technique used to build the phantom is general and applicable to phantoms of arbitrary shape and conductivity distribution. We describe three performance indicators that can be measured with our phantom for every measurement of an EIT data frame: SNR, accuracy, and modeling accuracy. These performance indicators were evaluated on our EIT system under different frame rates and applied current intensities. The performance indicators are dependent on frame rate, operating frequency, applied current intensity, measurement strategy, and intermodulation distortion when performing simultaneous measurements at several frequencies. These parameter values should, therefore, always be specified when reporting performance indicators to better appreciate their significance.","tags":["biomedical engineering"],"title":"A resistive mesh phantom for assessing the performance of EIT systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://martincousi.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]

otherwise, an opposite effect may be estimated, and incorrect recommendations may be given. To achieve this balance, there exist a wide variety of methods. In particular, several methods based on optimization models have been recently proposed in the causal inference literature. While these optimization-based methods showed empirical improvement over a limited number of other causal inference methods, they have not been thoroughly compared to each other and to the best causal inference methods in their relative ability to balance the pre-treatment measured covariates and to estimate the causal effect. In addition, we believe that there exist several unaddressed opportunities that operational researchers could contribute with their advanced knowledge of optimization, for the benefits of the applied researchers that use causal inference tools. In this review paper, we present an overview of the causal inference literature and describe in more detail the optimization-based causal inference methods, provide a comparative analysis of the prevailing optimization-based methods, and discuss opportunities for new methods.","tags":["causal inference","confounding","constrained optimization"],"title":"Estimating causal effects with optimization-based methods: A review and empirical comparison","type":"publication"},{"authors":["N Kullman","M Cousineau","J Goodson","J Mendoza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1606780800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606780800,"objectID":"d416a79b5c9b42fc1d7cb834e1fe6eb5","permalink":"https://martincousi.github.io/publication/dynamic-ridehailing/","publishdate":"2021-05-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dynamic-ridehailing/","section":"publication","summary":"We consider the problem of an operator controlling a fleet of electric vehicles for use in a ridehailing service. The operator, seeking to maximize profit, must assign vehicles to requests as they arise as well as recharge and reposition vehicles in anticipation of future requests. To solve this problem, we employ deep reinforcement learning, developing policies whose decision making uses Q-value approximations learned by deep neural networks. We compare these policies against a reoptimizationbased policy and against dual bounds on the value of an optimal policy, including the value of an optimal policy with perfect information which we establish using a Benders-based decomposition. We assess performance on instances derived from real data for the island of Manhattan in New York City. We find that, across instances of varying size, our best policy trained with deep reinforcement learning outperforms the reoptimization approach. We also provide evidence that this policy may be effectively scaled and deployed on larger instances without retraining.","tags":["reinforcement learning","machine learning","transportation"],"title":"Dynamic ridehailing with electric vehicles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["N Kullman","J Mendoza","M Cousineau","J Goodson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572566400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572566400,"objectID":"242cf622360c363e13fc5f4293fa28a7","permalink":"https://martincousi.github.io/publication/atari-vrpssr/","publishdate":"2021-05-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/atari-vrpssr/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a new general approach to modeling research problems as Atari-like videogames to make them amenable to recent groundbreaking solution methods from the deep reinforcement learning community.

In particular, this work focuses on methods to assist physicians towards achieving remission in patients suffering from treatment-resistant depression, a severe form of the major depressive disorder. Following a literature review of medical decision making methods relevant for treating depression, this thesis proposes medical decision making methods for (1) finding the best initial treatment modification for incoming patients, (2) characterizing the current timing decisions between appointments and (3) recommending potential successful treatments. All of these tasks are addressed using observational longitudinal data from the Depressive and Suicide Disorders Program of the Douglas Mental Health University Institute in Montreal.In particular, the first method focuses on the task of using observational data to determine which of five treatment modification strategies is best at the initial visit. To do so, the proposed method balances the five strategy groups using an improved approach for causal inference. The chapter associated with this method is also used as a tutorial to causal inference for the operations research and management science community.The second method identifies the relevant variables among the patient's, physician's and clinic's characteristics for the timing decisions between appointments. This decision is of importance due to the trade-off between high-frequency appointments that lead to a waste of resources and low-frequency appointments that lead to the degradation of patients. Using imitation learning on data, this method infers these variables and their weights. This knowledge can then be used by the physicians to refine and standardize their practice with respect to this decision.The third method recommends potential successful treatments using similarities between past patients and treatments. This recommender system consists somewhat of an extension of the first method where causal inference is again used. However, the treatment drugs are now considered instead of the five treatment modification strategies. For this method, we assume that the sequence of treatments that have been administered to the patient does not affect the efficacy of the current treatment.","tags":["analytics","healthcare","depression"],"title":"Analytics for medical decision making: Applications to the management of treatment-resistant depression","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M Cousineau","S Perron","G Caporossi","M Paiva","M Segatto"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"298bf6eeba5a19a3d27d3f64e0b99ed4","permalink":"https://martincousi.github.io/publication/rwa-otn/","publishdate":"2021-05-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rwa-otn/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents a decomposition approach for solving a variant of the routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problem, in which all connection requests are covered by geodesics, i.e., shortest paths with respect to the number of hops.

We also improve this method by proposing new ways of selecting the set of promising paths in the paths׳ selection phase.

The results show that our approach can find the optimal number of wavelengths or an interval on this number in a short computing time.

Our variant consists in minimizing the number of wavelengths required to all-to-all communication. Our decomposition approach is an extension of a recent method proposed in the literature, for the case of shortest paths. We also modify this method by proposing an improved path selection phase. The decomposition approach consists of four phases: (i) shortest paths computation; (ii) lower bound computation; (iii) selection of a shortest path per connection request; (iv) assignment of a wavelength to each connection request. Several methods have been proposed for the different phases but only one per phase has been kept after numerical experiments. This approach as well as a direct approach have been tested on 29 optical transport networks. The decomposition approach was able to solve these instances in less time than the direct approach while finding the optimal solution for 28 of them. For the remaining network, the approach was able to provide a small interval in which the optimal solution value resides. Finally, this approach can be used to accelerate the solution process of the direct approach by providing a good upper bound and a near optimal initial solution.","tags":["constrained optimization","constraint programming","optical transport networks"],"title":"Optimisation du routage et de l'affectation de longueurs d'onde sur un réseau de télécommunication par programmation mathématique","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H Gagnon","M Cousineau","A Adler","AE Hartinger"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1276473600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1276473600,"objectID":"df80252e9744aca3e0a315e38dfad22f","permalink":"https://martincousi.github.io/publication/phantom-eit/","publishdate":"2021-05-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/phantom-eit/","section":"publication","summary":"Assessing the performance of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) systems usually requires a phantom for validation, calibration, or comparison purposes. This paper describes a resistive mesh phantom to assess the performance of EIT systems while taking into account cabling stray effects similar to in vivo conditions. This phantom is built with 340 precision resistors on a printed circuit board representing a 2-D circular homogeneous medium. It also integrates equivalent electrical models of the Ag/AgCl electrode impedances. The parameters of the electrode models were fitted from impedance curves measured with an impedance analyzer. The technique used to build the phantom is general and applicable to phantoms of arbitrary shape and conductivity distribution. We describe three performance indicators that can be measured with our phantom for every measurement of an EIT data frame: SNR, accuracy, and modeling accuracy. These performance indicators were evaluated on our EIT system under different frame rates and applied current intensities. The performance indicators are dependent on frame rate, operating frequency, applied current intensity, measurement strategy, and intermodulation distortion when performing simultaneous measurements at several frequencies. These parameter values should, therefore, always be specified when reporting performance indicators to better appreciate their significance.","tags":["biomedical engineering"],"title":"A resistive mesh phantom for assessing the performance of EIT systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://martincousi.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
